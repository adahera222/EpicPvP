Git controls (if using GitBash):
	Add a file to git:
		git add <filename> 
			-- The cheap way is to use "git add -A", the -A is similar to "git add .; git add -u"
			-- "." = finds all new or modified files (does not remove any files)
			-- "-u" = finds modified files and removed files (does not add new ones)
	
	to commit to your local repo:
		git commit -m 'your message'

	to push those changes to the master shared repo
		git push origin master
			-- origin = the name of the shared repo
			-- master = the name of the repo on your machine
